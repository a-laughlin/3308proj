Should Pytorch being able to run on mobile determine our mobile framework?
  * + possible
  * - adds complexity
  * - creates potential blocking scenarios
  * can we revisit later?  Yes.
  * decision: for now, Pytorch will output to server (desktop for now). Once we have an api, mobile will get pytorch data from API.
