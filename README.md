# Project Title: Heart-a-tracker

# Team member’s names
Chris Powell
Adam Laughlin
Ben Wilson
Brian Solar

# Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
(ideas)
Predict future heart behavior

# Motivation: why are you working on this project?
This project combines the interests of our group into one cohesive idea. 

#  Risks and Mitigation Strategies:
## TODO - Finish writing Risk/Mitigation:
* No prior experience working with these team members. We are also remote with a couple people in different time zones. 
* Risk: Not learning the necessary tools/skills in time:
Pytorch, etc.
* Mitigation Strategy:
Fall back on simpler APIs, such as Keras/sklearn
Use tools that are in one’s experience

* Risk: Not having the necessary tools/frameworks available:
Backend not supporting Pytorch
* Mitigation Strategy:
Fall back on simpler APIs, or ones that are supported
Adapt the problem to one that can be accomplished with the available tools

* Risk: Not having the necessary data
Heart rate data (clean) over a period of time
* Mitigation Strategy:
Synthetically generate our own data 
Use publicly available data (such as on Kaggle or university research websites)

* Risk: One member not completing a task required for the group to move forward
* Mitigation Strategy:
Have each story assigned to two members (one primary, one secondary) to encourage accountability
Have early deadlines for completion, allowing an assessment on progression and follow-up action to push for a timely completion

* Risk: Lack of access to test devices
Building for iOS or Android with only some team members having access
* Mitigation Strategy:
Discuss what device we all have access to, possibly loading it onto our roommate’s phone to be able to complete stories on our own
Look for software that acts like a mobile OS as an environment

* Risk: Spending too much time at any point in the development
Creating too many stories or spending too many resources in a section that creates a limited amount of time for the other areas
* Mitigation Strategy:
Estimate the number of days and hours we have in total and attempt to assign portions of development to stages of the process, i.e. 10% to UI, 10% to data pipeline, 50% to neural network algorithm and improvements to it, etc…
Attempt to project manage on a larger scale before breaking it down into stories and sprints, understanding when we need to take the actions outlined above because we no longer have time to spend on that part of the project. 

* Risk: Different data collecting devices and data formats
Apple Watch, Garmin, FitBit, Jawbone, etc, with different data types
* Mitigation Strategy:
This could be luxury if we aren’t able to find time for it. 
Try to find an intermediary, such as Apple’s Health app, who already transforms and stores the data
